please make sure to mention about the observation found here: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/java-8-completablefuture-power-asynchronous-processing-shailesh-singh/
related to what executor is used by default

also make sure to describe the mechanism behind completablefuture: https://www.baeldung.com/java-asynchronous-programming

check if there is an executor that can change dinamically number of available threads


You must mention about what executor you used and how it works :))))
also you could mention why you choose this executor; and describe how exactly it works :))))

Don't forget to mention about: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/channels/Selector.html#select(long)
